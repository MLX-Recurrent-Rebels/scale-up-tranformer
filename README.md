# Project Title
A descriptive title for your project goes here.

## Description
This project focuses on developing and implementing machine learning models using PyTorch. It includes various Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating different aspects of model training, tokenization, and inference. Key components include:

- `train.ipynb`: Training models using PyTorch.
- `inference.ipynb`: Running inference with trained models.
- `mha_GPT.ipynb` and `my_GPT.ipynb`: Implementations of custom GPT models.
- `train_mha.ipynb`, `train_mha_avec_mp.ipynb`, and `train_orca.ipynb`: Advanced training techniques with multi-head attention and other optimizations.
- `dataset_bes.ipynb`: Notebook for handling and preparing the dataset.
- `tinystories_tokeniser.model` and `tinystories_tokeniser.vocab`: Tokenizer files for processing text data.

## Installation
To run the notebooks, ensure you have Jupyter and PyTorch installed. You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install jupyterlab
```
